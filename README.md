# Context
I was in the search for a twitch stream ripper that would monitor and save streams to my twitch synology folder to watch on plex while I'm unable to watch online.

I could not find an existing image that would respond exactly to my needs so I combined what I could find from few existing projects (see credits here below)

I decided to build it automatically on docker hub to access from my swarm nodes, when I saw many downloads, I decided to document a bit more the project, for my personnal experience and to encourage reusability

Questions, suggestions, requests, reach me out on [![alt text][1.1]][1]

I'm also interested with new projects for automation of daily popular tasks, don't hesitate, I'm waiting for new ideas

# Credits
Thanks to the work of the original owners, so far I used and adapted python scripts from 

https://github.com/Neolysion/Twitch-Recorder/blob/master/check.py

https://www.junian.net/2017/01/how-to-record-twitch-streams.html

I cleaned up and adapted following my requirements and added a slack integration

All rights are reserved to the original script owners, tell me if I need to remove those however, I might be working on a rewrite from scratch removing few dependencies to python libraries
