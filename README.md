# ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
We have renamed the master branch to main for clarity and to follow best practices. Please reconfigure your branch origin with the following commands:

# Context
I was in the search for a twitch stream ripper that would monitor and save streams to my twitch synology folder to watch on plex while I'm unable to watch online.

I could not find an existing image that would respond exactly to my needs so I combined what I could find from few existing projects (see credits here below)

I decided to build it automatically on docker hub to access from my swarm nodes, when I saw many downloads, I decided to document a bit more the project, for my personnal experience and to encourage reusability

Questions, suggestions, requests, reach me out on [![alt text][1.1]][1]

I'm also interested with new projects for automation of daily popular tasks, don't hesitate, I'm waiting for new ideas


```sh
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

I cleaned up and adapted following my requirements and added a slack integration

All rights are reserved to the original script owners, it has been now mostly reworked from scratch nevertheless will remove code if requested.

# Quality
Quality is specified within the stream, any twitch quality specified existing for the stream can be defined

Keywords can always be used
* best
* worst

# Variables

Environment variables are primarily used for Docker deployments. For Kubernetes/Helm deployments, configuration is managed via the `values.yaml` file and Kubernetes Secrets.

## timer
Specifies the interval (in seconds) to check for stream status.

    timer=360

## user (Docker only)
The Twitch username to monitor.

    user=heromarine

## quality (Docker only)
The desired stream quality (e.g., `best`, `worst`, `1080p60`).

    quality=best

## clientid, clientsecret, oauthtoken, slackid, telegrambottoken, telegramchatid (Docker only)
These variables are used for Docker deployments to provide necessary credentials. **For Kubernetes/Helm, these are managed via a Kubernetes Secret.**

    clientid=xxxxxxxx
    clientsecret=xxxxxxxx
    oauthtoken=xxxxxxxx
    slackid=xxxxxxxxx
    telegrambottoken=xxxxxxxxx
    telegramchatid=xxxxxxxxx

# Docker
    docker run -d --rm \
    -v twitch:/app/download \
    -e timer=360 \
    -e user=heromarine \
    -e quality=best \
    -e clientid=XxX \
    -e clientsecret=XxX \
    -e oauthtoken=XxX \
    -e slackid=XxX \
    -e telegrambottoken=XxX \
    -e telegramchatid=XxX \
    ghcr.io/liofal/streamlink:latest # Note: Image path updated to ghcr.io

# Compose
    -e timer=360 \
    -e user=heromarine \
    -e quality=best \
    -e clientid=XxX \
    -e clientsecret=XxX \
    -e slackid=XxX \
    liofal/streamlink:latest

# Compose

## Startup
To run a test service

    ./docker-compose -f dockerimages/streamlink/docker-compose.yml up -d test

## clientid.env
Specify the clientid.env file using the clientid.env.example delivered

## default.env
you can specify the default for compose here

# Volume
    /app/download 

_**Warning:** The folder does not exist in the container and need te be created as a volume in order to be accessed from outside your container, you should map it if you want to access it_

## FFmpeg Conversion

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes an FFmpeg service that automatically converts TS container files to MP4. The FFmpeg service is configured to run periodically and process files in the `/app/download` directory.

- The `SLEEPTIME` environment variable defines the interval (in seconds) between conversion checks. By default, it is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes).
- The `WORKDIR` environment variable specifies the directory where the TS files are located and where the converted MP4 files will be saved.

To customize the FFmpeg conversion settings, you can modify the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

# Kubernetes Deployment with Helm

To deploy this project on Kubernetes using Helm, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Namespace:**
    ```sh
    kubectl create namespace streamlink
    ```

2. **Add the Helm Repository:**
    ```sh
    helm repo add streamlink https://github.com/liofal/streamlink/kube/charts
    helm repo update
    ```

3. **Prepare the Shared Secret:**
    Before installing the chart, you must create a single, shared Kubernetes Secret containing the necessary API tokens and IDs for all your streamlink instances. The chart includes an example manifest at `kube/charts/templates/secret.example.yaml`.
    *   Copy `secret.example.yaml` to a new file (e.g., `streamlink-secrets.yaml`).
    *   Edit the new file:
        *   Ensure the `metadata.name` is set to the desired shared secret name (the default and recommended name is `streamlink-secrets`).
        *   Replace the placeholder values in the `data` section with your **base64 encoded** secrets (Twitch client ID/secret/token, Slack ID, Telegram bot token/chat ID). You can encode a value using `echo -n 'your-secret-value' | base64`.
    *   Apply the secret manifest to your cluster **once**:
        ```sh
        kubectl apply -f streamlink-secrets.yaml -n streamlink
        ```

4. **Customize Your `values.yaml`:**
    Create a `values.yaml` file (or use an existing one) for each streamlink instance you want to deploy. Ensure the `secretName` field is set to the name of the shared Secret you created in the previous step (e.g., `streamlink-secrets`). Here is an example configuration for one instance:
    ```yaml
    image:
      streamlink:
        repository: ghcr.io/liofal
        name: streamlink
        tag: 3.3.4
        pullPolicy: Always
      ffmpeg: 
        repository: ghcr.io/liofal
        name: ffmpeg6
        tag: 1.0.0
        pullPolicy: Always

    streamer:
      name: "<name_here>"
      twitchName: "<twitch_name_here>"
      quality: "best"
      timer: 120

    # Name of the Kubernetes Secret containing sensitive tokens.
    # This should point to the single, shared Secret created in Step 3.
    secretName: "streamlink-secrets" # Default name for the shared secret

    ffmpeg:
      sleeptime: "<sleeptime_value>"
      workdir: "<workdir_value>"

    nfs:
      server: <server_ip_here>
      path: /<volume>/<folder>
    ```

5. **Install the Helm Chart:**
    ```sh
    helm install my-streamlink streamlink/streamlink -n streamlink -f /path/to/your/values.yaml
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/values.yaml` with the path to your customized `values.yaml` file.

6. **Upgrade the Helm Release:**
    If you need to apply changes to your deployment, ensure your Secret is up-to-date, update your `values.yaml` file if necessary, and run:
    ```sh
    helm upgrade my-streamlink streamlink/streamlink -n streamlink -f /path/to/your/values.yaml
    ```

7. **Uninstall the Helm Release:**
    To remove the deployment (this does not remove the Secret):
    ```sh
    helm uninstall my-streamlink -n streamlink
    ```
